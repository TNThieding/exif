*******************************************************************************
[0.8.6] Make ``get()`` return default value if tag isn't readable. (2020-05-29)
*******************************************************************************

Previously, using ``get()`` to read a tag that can't be read by this package
raised a ``NotImplementedError``. Now, ``get()`` returns the default value (i.e.,
``None`` if not specified otherwise) if the specified tag cannot be read.

This patch addresses the following GitHub user issue:

* Method ``gets()`` raises ``NotImplementedError``. (https://github.com/TNThieding/exif/issues/30)

****************************************************
[0.8.5] Fix ``exif_version`` attribute. (2020-05-18)
****************************************************

Add support for reading ``exif_version`` attribute.

This patch addresses the following GitLab user issue:

* Reading ``exif_version`` fails with ``NotImplementedError``. (https://gitlab.com/TNThieding/exif/issues/20)

************************************************
[0.8.4] Restore Python 3.5 support. (2020-05-10)
************************************************

Remove format string usage throughout package to restore Python 3.5 support. Add Python 3.5 testing to CI/CD pipeline.

This patch addresses the following GitHub and GitLab user issues:

* Broken Python 3.5 compatibility with Release 0.8.3. (https://gitlab.com/TNThieding/exif/-/issues/21)
* Dependency on enum34 makes it impossible to build a conda package. (https://github.com/TNThieding/exif/issues/25)

***************************************************
[0.8.3] Mid-April 2020 bug fix rollup. (2020-04-20)
***************************************************

This patch addresses the following GitHub user issues:

- Fix reading ASCII tags containing 3 characters or less. (See https://github.com/TNThieding/exif/issues/12
  for more information.)
- Fix `gps_longitude_ref` and `gps_latitude_ref` decoding. (See https://github.com/TNThieding/exif/issues/24
  for more information).

*****************************************************
[0.8.2] Early-March 2020 bug fix rollup. (2020-03-10)
*****************************************************

This patch addresses the following GitHub user issues:

- Update PyPI classification to more clearly indicate that this package only supports Python 3.
  (See https://github.com/TNThieding/exif/issues/20 for discussion.)
- Add read-only support for Windows XP style tags. (See https://github.com/TNThieding/exif/issues/22
  for more information.)
- Fix a benign cursor increment bug in ``_app1_metadata.py``. (See
  https://github.com/TNThieding/exif/issues/18 for more information.)

This patch also addresses the following issues:

- The ``offset_time_digitized`` was previously incorrectly mapped to ``offset_time_original``.

***************************************************
[0.8.1] Restructure tag type behavior. (2019-07-28)
***************************************************

Replace complex and duplicated ``if`` statements with polymorphic tag datatypes.

************************************************
[0.8.0] Add ``has_exif`` attribute. (2019-07-07)
************************************************

Previously, instantiating an ``Image`` with a non-EXIF file raised an ``IOError``. Now, ``Image``
instantiation always succeeds and the ``has_exif`` attribute reports whether or not the image
currently has EXIF metadata.

******************************************************
[0.7.0] Support modifying image rotation. (2019-06-23)
******************************************************

Add support for modifying metadata with the SHORT datatype (e.g. image orientation). Add
``Orientation`` enumeration to facilitate rotating images.

*******************************************
[0.6.0] Drop Python 2 support. (2019-06-16)
*******************************************

Remove legacy Python 2 syntax from code.

This release includes the following under-the-hood changes:

- Migrate repository from GitHub to GitLab (including CI/CD).
- Pylint cleanup regarding Python 3 syntax.

***************************************************
[0.5.1] Mid-April 2019 bug fix rollup. (2019-04-14)
***************************************************

This patch addresses the following GitHub user issues:

- Previously, instantiating ``Image`` with an image file without a valid APP1 segment caused an
  infinite loop if the APP1 segment marker was found in the hexadecimal of the image itself. Now,
  the package raises an ``IOError`` indicating that the file isn't properly EXIF-encoded. (See
  https://github.com/TNThieding/exif/issues/14 for more information.)
- Previously, accessing an image's ``user_comment`` attribute raised an exception stating the
  datatype was unknown. Now, the package parses the ``user_comment`` attribute's special data
  structure as described in the EXIF specification so that users can access its value. (See
  https://github.com/TNThieding/exif/issues/15 for more information.)

***************************************************
[0.5.0] Add index/item access support. (2019-04-13)
***************************************************

Support indexed get, set, and delete access of EXIF tags. Also, offer ``set()`` and ``delete()`` methods.

This release includes the following under-the-hood changes:

- Add minimum Pylint score check to tox configuration.
- Update usage page to describe workflow and different access paradigms.

See https://github.com/TNThieding/exif/issues/13 for more information.

******************************************
[0.4.0] Add ``get()`` method. (2019-03-16)
******************************************

Previously, this package did not offer a mechanism to return a default value when attempting to access a missing tag,
causing users to rely heavily on try-except statements. Now, the ``Image`` class offers a ``get()`` method. This method
accepts a ``default=None`` keyword argument specifying the return value if the target attribute does not exist.

See https://github.com/TNThieding/exif/issues/7 for more information.

***********************************************
[0.3.1] Fix little endian support. (2018-02-10)
***********************************************

Previously, this package did not fully support little endian EXIF metadata in images, raising ``ValueError`` exceptions.
Now, reading EXIF hexadecimal strings and values takes endianness into account.

This release includes the following under-the-hood changes:

- Move tag reading and modification functions into the IFD tag class.
- Add enumerations for color space, sharpness, and saturation as a proof-of-concept for leveraging enumerations. (More
  enumerations coming soon in a future release!)
- Improve test coverage.

See https://github.com/TNThieding/exif/issues/5 for more information.

************************************************
[0.3.0] Add attribute list support. (2018-12-26)
************************************************

Implement mechanism for listing EXIF tags in an image using ``dir()``.

This release includes the following under-the-hood changes:

- Modularize hexadecimal string interface into an internal class.
- More robust test coverage and verification of hexadecimal data.

********************************************
[0.2.0] Add tag delete support. (2018-12-25)
********************************************

Add EXIF tag deletion support via Python delete attribute notation.

*******************************************
[0.1.0] Initial alpha release. (2018-12-23)
*******************************************

Release initial alpha version of ``exif`` package with the following features:

- Support for reading EXIF tags via Python get attribute notation.
- Support for modifying existing EXIF tags via Python set attribute notation.
